Clinic Booking System - Database Schema

This project contains a complete MySQL relational database schema for a Clinic Booking System.
It is designed to manage patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and related healthcare data.

Features

Relational Design: Implements Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Services, Prescriptions, and Invoices.

Constraints: Includes PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK constraints.

Relationships: Supports

One-to-One (e.g., Patient ↔ Medical Record),

One-to-Many (e.g., Doctor → Appointments),

Many-to-Many (e.g., Appointments ↔ Services).

Security: Includes roles and users tables for access control.

Deployment Instructions

Install MySQL 8.0 or later.

Open a terminal/command prompt.

Run the schema file:

mysql -u root -p < clinic_booking_system.sql


(Optional) Edit the seed section of the SQL file to create initial roles, users, and sample appointments.

Seed Data

The schema includes optional INSERT statements for:

Common appointment statuses (Scheduled, Checked-in, Completed, etc.).

Default user roles (Admin, Receptionist, Doctor).

A sample administrator account (update password_hash with a real secure hash before production).

Usage Notes

Ensure ENGINE=InnoDB is enabled to support foreign key constraints.

The schema uses utf8mb4 for full Unicode support.

Some CHECK constraints may be ignored in MySQL versions prior to 8.0.
